# FloorInt Implementation: Handling Tricky Cases

## Cases Our Implementation Handles Correctly ✓

### 1. **High Precision Numbers**
- ✓ `-3.000000000000000000001` → `-4`
- ✓ `2.999999999999999999999` → `2`
- These would be incorrectly rounded in float64 conversion

### 2. **Negative Numbers with Fractions**
- ✓ `-3.1` → `-4` (not `-3`!)
- ✓ `-0.1` → `-1` (not `0`!)
- Floor always rounds DOWN (toward negative infinity)

### 3. **Exact Integers**
- ✓ `3.0` → `3`
- ✓ `-3.0` → `-3`
- ✓ `6/2` → `3`
- No remainder means no adjustment needed

### 4. **Fractions and Percentages**
- ✓ `1/3` → `0`
- ✓ `-1/3` → `-1`
- ✓ `150%` → `1` (which is 1.5)
- ✓ `-150%` → `-2` (which is -1.5)

### 5. **Very Small Decimals**
- ✓ `0.000000000000000000001` → `0`
- ✓ `-0.000000000000000000001` → `-1`

### 6. **Large Numbers with Small Decimals**
- ✓ `1000000.000000000000000001` → `1000000`
- ✓ `-1000000.000000000000000001` → `-1000001`

## Known Limitations ⚠️

### 1. **Integer Overflow**
The current implementation has overflow issues:

```go
return int(quotient.Int64())
```

This causes problems when:
- The result exceeds `int64` range (±9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
- On 32-bit systems where `int` is `int32` (±2,147,483,647)

Examples of overflow:
- `999999999999999999999999999999` → Returns incorrect value (should panic or return error)
- Very large fractions that exceed int64 range

### 2. **No Overflow Detection**
The method doesn't check if the result fits in an `int` before conversion.

## Recommendations for Production Use

If you need to handle very large numbers safely, consider:

1. **Add a safe version with overflow checking:**
```go
func (r *Rational) FloorIntSafe() (int, error) {
    // ... calculate quotient ...
    if !quotient.IsInt64() {
        return 0, errors.New("result exceeds int64 range")
    }
    i64 := quotient.Int64()
    if i64 > math.MaxInt || i64 < math.MinInt {
        return 0, errors.New("result exceeds int range")  
    }
    return int(i64), nil
}
```

2. **Return *big.Int for unlimited precision:**
```go
func (r *Rational) FloorBigInt() *big.Int {
    // ... same algorithm but return quotient directly
}
```

3. **Add panic on overflow (if that's your error handling style):**
```go
if !quotient.IsInt64() {
    panic("FloorInt: result exceeds int64 range")
}
```

## Summary

The current implementation correctly handles all the mathematical edge cases for the floor function, including:
- High-precision decimals that would be lost in float64
- Correct behavior for negative numbers
- All types of rational number inputs

However, it has a known limitation with integer overflow that should be addressed based on your specific use case and error handling preferences.
